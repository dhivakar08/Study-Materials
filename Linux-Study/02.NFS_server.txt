NFS server
------------
NFS (Network File System) is basically developed for sharing of files and folders between Linux/Unix systems

Packaes : yum install nfs-utils* -y
Port    : 111 , 2049
Service : systemctl start nfs-server.Service
Path    : /etc/exports
Syntax  : Location  Destination (Permission)


Benefits of NFS
---------------------

1.NFS allows local access to remote files.
2.It uses standard client/server architecture for file sharing between all *nix based machines.
3.With NFS it is not necessary that both machines run on the same OS.
4.With the help of NFS we can configure centralized storage solutions.
5.Users get their data irrespective of physical location.
6.No manual refresh needed for new files.
7.Newer version of NFS also supports acl, pseudo root mounts.
8.Can be secured with Firewalls and Kerberos.

Note : The difference between ftp & NFS ftp we can provide user accounts but nfs configured using "N" devices

NFS server configuration
-------------------------

1. mkdir  /nfs_share

provide necessary permission to that share directory 

2. vim /etc/exports

/nfs_share   <enter the ip address of the client>(rw)       ---- rw is the read write permission

Examples
----------
1. If you want to share particular IP series you can specify 192.168.20.0/24
2. if you want to share particular domain series you can specify *example.com
3. If i provide only *(rw) who all are able to ping that machine it will share
---------------------------------------------------------------------

3. To verify it shared are not

# exportfs

4. start the nfs services

client configuration 
--------------------

1. To verify share is working 

# showmount -e <enter the ip address>

2. Mounting file create one mount directory

# mkdir /mnt/mount

3. Temporary mounting 

# mount -t nfs <ip address>:/nfs_share  /mnt/mount     ---- here -t is the type of mount

4. Verify tmp mount

# mount | grep nfs    (or)  df -Th

5. Permanent mounting

# vim /etc/fstab

# [sharefile]  [mount_dir]  [type_of_file] [default] [0 0]

- default   ---- here defaults is the option no of options available like exec,nonexec,user,nonuser

- 0         ---- the dump (backup utility) program. If the value is set to 0, then the partition is excluded from taking backup.
                 if the option is a nonzero value, the filesystem will be backed up.

- 0         ---- Mentions the fsck option. That is if the value is set to zero, the device or partition will be excluded from fsck check. 
                 if it is nonzero the fsck check will be run in the order in which the value is set.1 means first check fsck 2 maens reboot.

Note : The FSCK is a system utility. It is a tool that is used to check the consistency of a file system in the Unix-like operating systems.

NFS Permissions :
-----------------
1. rw             - Reand and write
2. ro             - Rean only
3. sync           - shared directory only once the changes have been committed.
4. async          - specifies that the server does not have to wait
5. no_root_squash - This phrase allows root to connect to the designated directory / does not change the mapping of remote users
6. squash_all      - to squash all remote users including root


Important commands for NFS
---------------------------
1.showmount -e : Shows the available shares on your local machine
2.showmount -e <server-ip or hostname>: Lists the available shares at the remote server
3.showmount -d : Lists all the sub directories
4.exportfs -v : Displays a list of shares files and options on a server
5.exportfs -a : Exports all shares listed in /etc/exports, or given name
6.exportfs -u : Unexports all shares listed in /etc/exports, or given name
7.exportfs -r : Refresh the serverâ€™s list after modifying /etc/exports

Note : If yu assign (rw) permission in exports file but your file have (r) permissions means client cannot edit your file.
       So both the permission will same then only client will edit your files.
