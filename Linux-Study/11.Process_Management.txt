Process in Linux
-----------------
1. Process carries out tasks in OS
2. Process is a computer application doing something, in action
3. Each process does seprate tasks with own rights
4. If one process crashes, it will not cause other processes to crash 

Type of Process
-----------------
1. User Process
                - It started by a regular user and they run in user space
                - It has no special access to CPU or to the files that doesn't belongs to him

2.Daemon Process 
                - Designed to run in the background
                - Managing some kind of ongoing service
                - Like "sshd","httpd","crond"| daemons always end with "d"
                - Normally managed as service by user root and they procees often run as "non-root" user by a user account (sshd | ftp users)
                - The daemons are started automatically and running backgroud 
                - Advantages of running daemon process as "non-root" is that system is better protectrd, in event of the attack.
                - Often started at boot time and run untill the system is shut down
                - daemons can be started / stopped on demand, using "systemctl" command
         
         3. kernel Process
                - Similar to daemon procees
                - They run / execute in the kernel space
                - primary difference is that kernel process have full access to kernel data structure, that makes more powerful that daemon process
                - not flexible as daemon process, I can change the behavior of daemon process, by changing the configuration files...
                  but to change the behaviour of kernel processes, one may need to recompile the kernel 

         Process state 
         -------------
         Most processes will be in one of the 2 states
         1. Running state - process in on CPU
         2. Not-running state - process is off the CPU

         List the process
         ----------------
         1. ps     - It display only the running process of the CPU 
         2. ps ax  -  It will display all the 3 type of process 
         3. ps lax - It will show more detial about the process      VSZ - Virtual memory, RSS - Non swaped physical memory
         4. Ps ef  - It shows the user information of the process, Which user has started the process
         5. pstree - It shows the process tree information
         6. pstree -P <user name> | it shows the process started with the user
         7. Top   

 Kill the process
 -----------------
 1. Checking the PID of the process
    pidof  <application name> /  pgrep <application name>

    # kill <PID>     ------ kill -l it will list out the killing signals 

 changing the priority of the process
 --------------------------------------
 Why I should change the priority of a process?

 1. A process might consume all the resources, its heavy. It may leads to resource crunch for other processess
    I might want to increase the nice value
 2. I want to increase the resources to a process.. it can be finished fast. I will decrease the nice value.
 3. The nice values are -20 to 19 for better performance the nice value should +, - means high priority 
    
    changing the nice value is 
    
    # renice -n <value> -p <PID>  --- already running   for running using #nice  

 4. Putting jobs to the backgroud using &

 5. Finding the backgroud jobs using #jobs command
