Controlling services and daemons using systemctl commands

Boot Process being with :
-------------------------
1.BIOS (Basic Inupt/Output System)
After completing hardware initialization and checks
2.Boot loader is loaded - GRUB
3.Boot loader access MBR (Master Boot Record) on HDD
4.uses the data there o start Linux kernel
5."systemd"is the first process started by kernel on RHEL (pid 1)
6.systemd then starts all the necessary daemons,background processes and service required to make the OS work.

 Introduction to systemd
 ------------------------
 1.systemd is a system and service manager
 2.compatible with sys v init scripts in rhel 5 and 6
 3.parallel startup of services at boot time
 4.systemd introduces a concept of "system units"
 5.system units are represented by unit configuration files:
   1./etc/systemd/system         - managed by admin
   2./run/systemd/system         - created at runtime
   3./usr/lib/systemd/system     - distributed with package installation

 What is units
 -------------
 1.Any resource that the system knows how to operate & manage.
 2.These resources are defined using configuration files called "unit files"
 3.Units are classified based on types of resurces they describe, common are:
   1.service units
   2.socket units
   3.path units
   4.mount units
   5.device units
   6.target units 

 1.systemctl                     ----- it shows all the services
 2.systemctl --type=service      ----- it shows only particular services

 Note : # systemctl list-dependencies httpd.service   ------ it will show the related service dependencies

 3.systemctl edit --full sshd.service    -------- with out knowing the actual configuration file we can edit "restartsec" we can edit

 4.systemctl cat sshd.service            -------- with out open it will show the content

 5.systemctl show sshd.service
