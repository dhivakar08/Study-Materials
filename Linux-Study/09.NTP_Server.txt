How NTP Works
-------------
Purpose : Synchronize the clocks of a server constellation to UTC 

Utility : Time stamps are used every where, Starting from log files to banking apps Airline industory.

Packet Exchange : UDP Protocol - port 123

Packet sent : 
------------
         ---------> Client send the request with its timestamp
         <--------- Server returns the packet with 3 timestamps
                    1.Echo of the client time stamp
                    2.When did i (Server) receive request?
                    3.When did i (server) send the response?

 -Client estimate the offset between him and the server
 -client can have many servers
 -client choose only one NTP server to sync time
 -minimize the offset and skew with feedback loop

 Network Use of NTP
 -------------------
  - pairof very small packets at every 64 - 1024 seconds for each server
  - As per the latest estimate only 0.01% of world traffic on internet is of NTP ..... (less than 5 GB per day)

  NTP with RHEL 7
  ----------------
  - Latest versions is NTP v4
  - The speed of communication between NTP client and NTP server will be 8 times more if "iburst" keywork is used.

 HOW IT Works ???
 -----------------
 - Mr. David Mills, 1985
 - Based on "Marzullo's" algorithm. But it is used only by high stata servers to get accurate time using several sources.

 -But normally, a normal client, on a normal day will use only one server

 -NTP time stamps, are stored in seconds, since 1 january, 1990

 -Time stamp is actually a 64 bit in size. 32 bit is for number of seconds and 32 bit is for fraction of seconds.

 Congiguration file 
 -------------------
 1. Rhel 7  - /etc/chrony.conf
 2. Rhel 6  - /etc/ntp.conf

 commands
